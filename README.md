### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)
### Run the below commands to install Jenkins and java if you are on a ubuntu or debian machine
```
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre
sudo apt-get install jenkins

```
### Run the below commands to install Jenkins and java if you are on a redhat or fedora machine
```
sudo yum update
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io-2023.key
 sudo dnf upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo dnf install fontconfig java-21-openjdk 
```

# If you are on amazon linux machine, use the following command to install java
```
 sudo amazon-linux-extras enable corretto11
 sudo yum install -y java-21-amazon-corretto
```
# Verify Java is Installed, make sure the version of java should be latest and compatible with jenkins.
```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```
sudo dnf install jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
# Check if the jenkins is running on port 8080 or anything other than jenkins running on port 8080
```
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 8080
```
# If there is some problem running the jenkins server, run the below commands
```
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 sudo systemctl start jenkins
```
 # To check the logs for jenkins, run the following commands
 ```
 sudo cat /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
 sudo systemctl status jenkins
 ls /var/log/jenkins
 sudo systemctl status jenkins -l
```
   
# **Note: ** If you are on AWS By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed `All traffic`).

```

### If you are on vmware or virtual machine, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the firewall restrictions of the port by the ubuntu os. Allow port 8080 in the firewall as show below.
```
sudo ufw allow 8080
sudo ufw reload
```
# Also check the network connection is selected to bridged connection which you want to access the jenkins server from any browser other than the host
# Also choose

# Go to automatic settings and select the wireless or wifi adapter you are connected to and uncheck all other options

### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]
or http://<vm-ip-address>:8080
Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password
